## Network Architecture
### Dense Matcher

### Fusion Network
![Architecture of the fusion network $\mathcal{N}_F$. Conv($c, k$) denotes a convolutional layer with $c$ output channels and kernel size of $k\times k$; GSAM indicates the global spatial attention module.](https://github.com/Linfeng-Tang/SuperFusion/blob/main/Figure/FusionNet.jpg)

### Global Spatial Attention Module (GSAM)

The purple textures are the gradients of registered infrared images and the backgrounds are the corresponding ground truths.
